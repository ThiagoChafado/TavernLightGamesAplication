In this task, I did not find any very explicit errors. 
This code snippet logs out a player. 
It has an auxiliary releaseStorage function to set the value of the key addressed in the 1000 header to -1
The OnLogout function checks this value. If it is 1, it indicates that the player is logged in, and should be logged out. If it is not 1, then the player is already logged out, and nothing should be done.
The changes I made were commenting the code and adding a false return, which can be useful in the case of later debugging.
